        Born Alive Bill Improving Everyone’s Safety (BABIES) Bill
    </h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    The BABIES Act redefines "abortion" to prioritize preserving the life of a natal entity when viable medical
    technology exists. It balances a gestational carrier’s right to terminate a pregnancy with the requirement to employ life-sustaining interventions for the
    natal entity, consistent with state laws and medical standards. By establishing clear life-saving protocols, the
    law enhances abortion care, enabling emergency and medical professionals to perform abortions with greater clarity
    and support.

        <li><b>Unintentional:</b> Errors despite reasonable efforts (e.g., equipment failure despite maintenance)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>This law only applies to a gestational carrier who wants to terminate parental rights before natural birth.  This law does not regulate conception that happens outside of the uterus, e.g., in vitro fertilization.  This law also does not regulate a mother who wishes to continue parental rights with the child/natal entity.</p>

    <p>The choice of delivery method (e.g., C-section or vaginal delivery) is at the discretion of the gestational
        carrier and medical provider, provided it does not pose a life-terminating abortion to the natal entity or harm to the gestational carrier. </p>

    <p>A natal entity life-terminating abortion (as defined above) is prohibited at or after the stage specified in
        the delivery term as specified in this paragraph.  The first term limit, labeled "Current Legal
            Time Frame Specification", is 30 weeks or later.</p>


    


    <h2>Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
    
    <h3>Gestational Carrier</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act preserves the gestational carrier’s right to an abortion (as defined above) within state-specific
        time limits where the natal entity resides.</p>
    <p>If the gestational carrier chooses abortion (as defined above), medical professionals must attempt
        life-sustaining measures for the
        natal entity using available technology, adhering to the delivery-term requirements.</p>
    <p>Upon opting for abortion (as defined above) the gestational carrier must sign an agreement relinquishing
        decision-making authority to medical staff, the state where the natal entity resides and federal government
        until delivery. Signing the contract does not negate visitation rights.</p>
    <p>If the gestational carrier is a surrogate, the financial responsibility falls on the adoptive parent(s).</p>
    
    <p>If the gestational carrier wishes to retain parental rights during state where the natal entity resides or
        federal custody:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Written notice of the wish to regain financial responsibility and parental rights must be submitted to the
            current payer and the state where the natal entity resides or federal government for review.</li>
        <li>The state where the natal entity resides or federal government must give a final decision within 30 days.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tax credits related to the gestational carrier’s contributions apply until delivery occurs.</p>
    <p>Upon either delivery or the natal entity’s death, the gestational carrier will receive a notice confirming
        the termination of the gestational carrier’s rights. This notice, primarily for tax purposes, does not require
        disclosure of the outcome but must include contact
        information for the gestational carrier to inquire about resuming responsibility for the natal entity, if
        applicable.</p>
    <p>A surrogate may terminate the pregnancy within the time limits specified by state law where the natal entity
        resides and the time frame from the delivery term if the intended parents relinquish responsibility. Suppose the
        surrogate wants to abort, as defined above, and the intended parents want to keep responsibility of
        the natal entity. In that case, the intended parents are free to pay for life-sustaining care through their
        payer.</p>
    <p>Normal tax procedures about tax credits will go into effect for surrogates.</p>
    <p>Any harm to the gestational carrier falls under other legislation and rules set by regulatory bodies by
        federal and state governments.</p>

    <h4>Contributor</h4>
    <p>This law recognizes that the contributor's actions created the natal entity; however, because the general federal
        law does not recognize the contributor's right to the natal entity inside the gestational carrier, all financial
        burden will be placed on the gestational carrier until removal from the gestational carrier occurs. Once the
        natal entity can be independent of the gestational carrier, the contributor may be treated as a parent
        according to state laws after paternity has been established.</p>
    <p>Once delivery (as defined above) has occurred, the parental rights of the contributor will be removed once the state has custody.</p>
<p>If the contributor is financially responsible for the care of the natal entity, the contributor can sign a rights termination agreement similar to the gestational carrier.</p>
    
    <h3>Natal Entity</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act prohibits any gestational carrier, medical professional, or other individual from intentionally
        causing the death of a natal entity during the period specified in the delivery term, or as restricted by
        state
        law where the natal entity resides.</p>

    <h4>Death of A Natal Entity</h4>

    <p>State abortion limits where the natal entity resides in during the conception term takes precedence.</p>

    <h5>Current Legal Time Frame Specification:</h5>

    <p>Natal entities have the right to life and are considered a person under the Constitution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When fat cells form inside the natal entitiy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Suppose a natal entity dies between the delivery term and the removal of the natal entity:
        Medical professionals must review the medical team in a medical review within three (3) months of the death
        and
        demonstrate that all available life-saving measures for the fetus and gestational carrier were employed.
    </p>
    <p>Fines</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Willful death of a natal entity before, during, or after an abortion procedure (as defined
            above), excluding the conception term,
            is liable for a loss of license and civil penalties of a minimum of $5,000 (maximum of $10,000) per
            natal entity
            after a medical professional has been found guilty of intentional death.</li>
        <li>A minimum penalty of $1,000 (maximum of $5000) per natal entity and required retraining will be
            imposed if unintentional errors are found.</li>
        <li>Any financial penalties resulting from a natal entity lawsuit are imposed on the payer, not the
            gestational carrier.</li>
        <li>Charge for the abortion can never include an amount to cover the fee.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Natal entities may be used for research only if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The natal entity is no longer living, and</li>
        <li>The practitioner has not been found liable for the penalties mentioned in this bill.
            Natal entities may not be used for for-profit purposes with fines at a minimum of $10,000
            (maximum $30,000) per
            natal entity if convicted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All research involving natal entities must be approved and overseen by an Institutional Review Board
        (IRB) to ensure compliance with ethical standards, including informed consent and harm
        minimization.</p>
    <p>Researchers must submit anonymized reports on research outcomes to a publicly accessible federal
        database, promoting transparency and advancing scientific knowledge while protecting privacy.
        IRBs must have at least one patient advocate or community representative to reflect diverse
        perspectives.</p>
    </ul>
 <h3>Adoption Guardians:</h3>
    <ul>
    <p>Under the BABIES Act, finalized adoption may occur according to state regulations where the adoption guardians
        reside three (3) months after the gestational carrier had the abortion (as defined above)or delivery, whichever
        comes first.</p>
    <p>Upon finalization of adoption, the adoptive guardians’ insurance coverage takes effect for the natal entity.
        Records of potential guardianship contact must be kept.</p>
</ul>
    </ul>

            equipment)</li>
        <li><b>Unintentional:</b> Errors despite reasonable efforts (e.g., equipment failure despite maintenance)</li>

     <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>Upon passage, the term “abortion” in the Hyde Amendment is redefined as “life-terminating abortion.”
        to ensure federal funding supports life-sustaining care for natal entities. This new phrasing is considered
        an essential part of The BABIES Act, while not violating the intention of the original phrasing in The Hyde
        Amendment.</p>


    <h3>Payer</h3>
    <p>The Hyde Amendment Revision stipulates that the state where the natal entity resides and federal insurance coverage apply
        to the natal entity.</p>
    <p>Financial incentives, if any, are directed to the payer, not the gestational carrier, outside of a premium
        payment refund equal to the contribution.</p>
    <p>Upon a delivery or the death of the natal entity, the payer will receive a notice confirming the termination
        of the gestational carrier’s rights. This document must include legally required details for standard medical
        notices to payers.</p>

    <h3>Federal Government</h3>
    <p>Following delivery, the state where the natal entity resides assumes custody and financial responsibility for
        it. Federal funding and a revised Hyde Amendment support life-sustaining care for the natal entity.</p>

    <h4>Congressional Review</h4>
    <p>Congress will review the time frames at least every 5 years.</p>
    <p>If technological advancements demonstrate earlier viability, Congress may adjust the time frame closer to
        conception for The BABIES Act.</p>
    <p>The time frame may only shift closer to birth if statistically significant increases (≥5% rise in maternal or
        natal entity mortality or severe morbidity, e.g., permanent disability, in peer-reviewed studies) in
        gestational carrier or natal entities’ mortality or debilitating physical harm are proven, with mandatory reviews every 5
        years to prioritize moving the limit closer to conception.</p>


    <p>The federal government must create a fund for natal entity care, administered through the Department of Health
        and Human Services.</p>
    <p>Annual appropriations will be tied to inflation and technological costs.</p>
    <p>Funding will cover equipment, staff training, gestational carrier and adoptive guardian support, and natal
        entity care during state custody, prioritizing underserved regions.</p>
    <p>Annual reports to Congress on fund usage and outcomes will be submitted to ensure transparency and
        accountability.</p>
    <p>The BABIES Act establishes a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) under the Department of Health and Human
        Services, comprising neonatologists, obstetricians, bioethicists, and public health experts. The SAC shall assess
        advancements in medical technology, every five years and recommend adjustments to the “Current Legal Time Frame Specification” in The BABIES Act
        based on peer-reviewed evidence.</p>
    <p>The committee must hold public hearings and publish draft recommendations for stakeholder input at least 90 days
        before submitting final recommendations to Congress.</p>



   


    <h3>Medical Facilities</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act applies whenever an abortion (as defined above) takes place. Facilities must maintain
        life-sustaining
        equipment capable of supporting natal entities during the delivery term. The following timeline is for the
        facilities to show their good-faith effort to follow the law:</p>


    <h4>Transfer</h4>
    <p>Medical facilities can safely transfer responsibility to other medical centers within a reasonable
        life-sustaining distance.</p>
    <p>A written transfer agreement mentioning methods, return of equipment procedures, timelines, etc., must be in
        place
        by the time the transfer vehicle arrives at the receiving facility.</p>
    <p>Transfers cannot occur to a state that would allow for the death of the natal entity.</p>
    <p>Both facilities must have records of these documents within 30 days.</p>
    <p>Transfers must prioritize the nearest facility capable of providing life-sustaining care, regardless of state
        lines,
        to minimize delays.</p>
    <p>If the transfer has to cross state lines, the law of the final destination will govern. However, to avoid legal
        disputes during emergencies, the laws of the originating state are to apply until the natal entity is stable.
    </p>



    <h4>Specific Introductory Timeline:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Year 1: Conduct feasibility studies and secure funding that inspectors of the HHS can review at
            anytime.</li>
        <li>Year 2: Begin acquiring equipment and training staff.</li>
        <li>Year 3 to 5: Facilities must have equipment to sustain natal entities simultaneously until they achieve
            independent viability:
            <ul>
                <li>Facilities with less than a hundred (100) beds must maintain equipment and supplies to sustain two
                    (2) natal
                    entities until delivery;</li>
                <li>Facilities with a hundred (100) beds or more must maintain equipment and supplies to support five
                    (5) natal
                    entities until delivery.</li>
                <li>These numbers may be reduced if transfer facilities that are capable of housing fifty (50) or more
                    natal entities
                    are within a life-sustaining distance, and a written agreement for the right to transfer is in place.
                </li>
                <li>Extended timelines (up to seven years) for rural or underfunded facilities are possible, contingent
                    on a plan to
                    meet requirements within 10 years.</li>
                <li>The facility must report on progress to the fund for natal entity care every two (2) years.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
