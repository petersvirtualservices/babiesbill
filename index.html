        Born Alive Bill Improving Everyone’s Safety (BABIES) Bill
    </h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The BABIES Act redefines "abortion" to prioritize preserving the life of a natal entity when viable medical
    technology exists. It balances a gestational carrier’s right to terminate a pregnancy with the requirement to employ life-sustaining interventions for the
    natal entity, consistent with state laws and medical standards. By establishing clear life-saving protocols, the
    law enhances abortion care, enabling emergency and medical professionals to perform abortions with greater clarity
    and support.</p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Natal Entity:</b> A child encompassing all stages of prenatal and postnatal development
            until independence from medical-assisted devices can be achieved.</li>
        <li><b>Abortion:</b> The intentional termination of a pregnancy through the removal of a natal entity with the intention to give up parental rights, with
            life-sustaining measures provided when technology is feasible.</li>
        <li><b>Life-Terminating Abortion:</b> An abortion resulting in the intentional termination of the natal
            entity’s life, subject to state-specific time limits.</li>
        <li><b>Medical-Assisted Device:</b> Technology used to sustain the life of a natal entity, such as
            incubators or artificial wombs.</li>
        <li><b>Gestational Carrier:</b> The individual carrying the pregnancy (e.g., egg donor or surrogate).</li>
        <li><b>Birth:</b>The process of giving birth to the natal entity and successfully transferred to the Medical Assisted Device.</li>
        <li><b>Contributor:</b> The individual who contributed the sperm.</li>
        <li><b>Current Legal Time Frame Specification:</b> The agreed-upon time that an abortion cannot occur afterwards.  It is determined by 
        what stage of development is occurring.</li>
        <li><b>Delivery:</b> Life-sustaining delivery of the natal entity from the medical-assisted device.</li>
        <li><b>Delivery Term:</b> The stage of the natal entity’s existence from the “Current Legal Time Frame
            Specification” to delivery.</li>
        <li><b>Conception Term:</b> The stage of the natal entity’s existence from conception to the “Current Legal
            Time Frame Specification”.</li>
        <li><b>Payer:</b> The entity financially responsible for the natal entity, including, but not limited to,
            insurance, government insurance, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Underfunded:</b> Facilities operating at a loss for over two years and earning less than $500 million.</li>
        <li><b>Rural:</b> Facilities that are more than fifty (50) miles from a tertiary care center.</li>
        <li><b>Intentional:</b> Deliberate actions or gross negligence (e.g., ignoring available life-sustaining
            equipment)</li>
        <li><b>Unintentional:</b> Errors despite reasonable efforts (e.g., equipment failure despite maintenance)</li>
        

    </ul>

    <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>This law only applies to a gestational carrier who wants to terminate a pregnancy and parental rights before natural birth.  
        This law does not regulate conception that happens outside of the uterus, e.g., in vitro fertilization.  This law also does not 
        regulate a mother who never terminated parental rights while the natal entity was in the womb.</p>

    <p>The choice of delivery method (e.g., C-section or vaginal delivery) is at the discretion of the gestational
        carrier and medical provider, provided it does not pose a life-terminating abortion to the natal entity or 
        harm to the gestational carrier during the delivery term or what is prescribed by state law concerning life-terminating abortions in the conception term. </p>

    <p>A natal entity life-terminating abortion (as defined above) is prohibited at or after the stage specified in
        the delivery term as specified in this paragraph.  The first term limit, labeled "Current Legal
            Time Frame Specification", is when all organs are developed and able to sustain life, generally 28 weeks.</p>


    


    <h2>Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
    
    <h3>Gestational Carrier</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act preserves the gestational carrier’s right to an abortion (as defined above) within state-specific
        time limits where the gestational carrier resides.  If the state has laws that specify a time when life-terminating abortions 
        are not allowed, those laws will prevail.</p>
    <p>If the gestational carrier chooses abortion (as defined above), medical professionals must attempt
        life-sustaining measures for the natal entity using available technology, in accordance with the delivery-term requirements.</p>
    <p>Upon opting for abortion (as defined above), the gestational carrier must sign an agreement relinquishing
        decision-making authority to medical staff, the state/federal government where the natal entity resides until delivery. 
        Signing the contract does not negate visitation privileges. A general agreement for all states needs to be signed so that a new one doesn't need 
        to be signed for each transfer.</p>
    <p>The gestational carrier must not be forced to abort the natal entity without a written consent signed with a sound mind.  Exceptions may only be made if 
    the gestational carrier is legally unable to enter into a contract.  Even then, an attempt for the gestational carrier to understand the process must be made.</p>
    <p>If the gestational carrier is a surrogate, a special case will be had so that the financial responsibility will belong to the 
        adoptive parent(s) before the birth begins, so that all financial responsibility belongs to the adoptive parent(s).</p>    
    <p>If the gestational carrier wishes to retain parental rights when the state/federal government has custody:
    <ul>
        <li>Written notice of the wish to regain financial responsibility and parental rights must be submitted to the
            current payer and the state where the natal entity resides or the federal government for review.</li>
        <li>The state where the natal entity resides or the federal government must give a final decision within 30 days.  
            If no decision has been made, and the written notice was notarized to show proof of attempt of submission, 
            the gestational carrier/payer will obtain rights to the entity, but medical care will continue until delivery can occur.
        </li>
        <li>The gestational carrier must understand that once the natal entity has been birthed, personhood cannot be removed from the natal entity even
        if the rights are granted again to the gestational carrier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tax credits related to the gestational carrier’s contributions apply until delivery occurs.</p>
    <p>Upon either delivery or the natal entity’s death, the gestational carrier will receive a notice confirming
        the termination of the gestational carrier’s rights. This notice, primarily for tax purposes, does not require
        disclosure of the outcome but must include contact information for the gestational carrier to inquire about resuming 
        responsibility for the natal entity, if applicable.  Litigation may not come from the gestational carrier if parental rights have been signed over.</p>
    <p>A surrogate may terminate the pregnancy within the time limits specified by state law where the natal entity
        resides and the time frame from the delivery term if the intended parents relinquish responsibility. Suppose the
        surrogate wants to abort, as defined above, and the intended parents want to keep responsibility of
        the natal entity. In that case, the intended parents are free to pay for life-sustaining care through their
        payer.  If that changes, the adoptive parent(s) must sign a written notice of relinquishment of rights.</p>
    <p>Normal tax procedures about tax credits will go into effect for surrogates/adoptive parent(s).</p>
    <p>Any harm to the gestational carrier falls under other legislation and rules set by regulatory bodies of
        the federal and state governments.</p>
    <p>This law does not bar the gestational carrier from entering into litigation with the contributor to pay for medical expenses.</p>

    <h4>Contributor</h4>
    <p>This law recognizes that the contributor's actions created the natal entity; however, because the general federal
        law does not recognize the contributor's right to the natal entity inside the gestational carrier, all financial
        burden will be placed on the gestational carrier until removal from the gestational carrier occurs. Once the
        natal entity can be independent of the gestational carrier, the contributor may be treated as a parent
        according to state laws after written notice of acceptance of responsibility.  Parental testing may only be done if the natal entity is strong enough to withstand the tests.</p>
    <p>Once delivery (as defined above) has occurred, the parental rights of the contributor will be removed once the state has custody.</p>
<p>If the contributor is financially responsible for the care of the natal entity, the contributor can sign a rights termination agreement 
    similar to the gestational carrier before delivery.</p>
    
    <h3>Natal Entity</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act prohibits any gestational carrier, medical professional, or other individual from intentionally
        causing the death of a natal entity during the period specified in the delivery term, or as restricted by
        state law where the natal entity resides.</p>

    <h4>Death of A Natal Entity</h4>

    <p>State abortion limits where the natal entity resides during the conception term take precedence.  
        This law is only meant to go in effect when abortion is legal.  The gestational carrier is allowed to cross state lines if an abortion is needed,
    but the requirement to keep the natal entity alive during the delivery term will abide.</p>

    <h5>Current Legal Time Frame Specification:</h5>

    <p>Natal entities have the right to life and are considered a person under the Constitution:</p>

    <p>Suppose a natal entity dies between the delivery term and the removal of the natal entity:
        Medical professionals must review the medical team in a medical review within three (3) months of the death
        and demonstrate that all available life-saving measures for the fetus and gestational carrier were employed.
    </p>
    <p>Fines</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Willful death of a natal entity before, during, or after an abortion procedure (as defined
            above), excluding the conception term,
            is liable for a loss of license and civil penalties of a minimum of $5,000 (maximum of $10,000) per
            natal entity after a medical professional has been found guilty of intentional death.</li>
        <li>A minimum penalty of $1,000 (maximum of $5000) per natal entity and required retraining will be
            imposed if unintentional errors are found.</li>
        <li>Any financial penalties resulting from a natal entity lawsuit are imposed on the payer, not the
            gestational carrier.</li>
        <li>Charge for the abortion can never include an amount to cover the fee.</li>
        <li>These amounts may increase to accommodate inflation.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Natal entities may be used for research only if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The natal entity is no longer living, and</li>
        <li>The practitioner has not been found liable for the penalties mentioned in this bill.
            Natal entities may not be used for for-profit purposes, with fines at a minimum of $10,000
            (maximum $30,000) per natal entity if convicted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All research involving natal entities must be approved and overseen by an Institutional Review Board
        (IRB) to ensure compliance with ethical standards, including informed consent and harm minimization.</p>
    <p>Researchers must submit anonymized reports on research outcomes to a publicly accessible federal
        database, promoting transparency and advancing scientific knowledge while protecting privacy.
        IRBs must have at least one patient advocate or community representative to reflect diverse
        perspectives.</p>
    </ul>
 <h3>Adoption Guardians:</h3>
    <ul>
    <p>Under the BABIES Act, finalized adoption may occur according to state regulations where the natal entitiy
        resides three (3) months after the gestational carrier had the abortion (as defined above) or delivery, whichever
        comes first.</p>
    <p>Upon finalization of adoption, the adoptive guardians’ insurance coverage takes effect for the natal entity.
        Records of potential guardianship contact must be kept.</p>
</ul>
    </ul>

 </ul>

    
<h1>Hyde Amendment Revision</h1>
    <ul>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
    <li>All definitions are the same As The BABIES Act.<li/>

     <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>Upon passage, the term “abortion” in the Hyde Amendment that disqualifies from federal funding is redefined as “life-terminating abortion.”
        to ensure federal funding supports life-sustaining care for natal entities. This new phrasing is considered
        an essential part of The BABIES Act, while not violating the intention of the original phrasing in The Hyde Amendment.</p>


    <h3>Payer</h3>
    <p>The Hyde Amendment Revision stipulates that the state where the natal entity resides and federal insurance coverage apply
        to the natal entity.</p>
    <p>Financial incentives, if any, are directed to the payer, not the gestational carrier, outside of a premium
        payment refund equal to the contribution.</p>
    <p>Upon a delivery or the death of the natal entity, the payer will receive a notice confirming the termination
        of the gestational carrier’s rights. This document must include legally required details for standard medical
        notices to payers.</p>

    <h3>Federal Government</h3>
    <p>Following delivery, the state where the natal entity resides assumes custody and financial responsibility for
        it. Federal funding and a revised Hyde Amendment support life-sustaining care for the natal entity.</p>

    <h4>Congressional Review</h4>
    <p>Congress will review the time frames at least every 5 years.</p>
    <p>If technological advancements demonstrate earlier viability, Congress may adjust the time frame closer to
        conception for The BABIES Act.</p>
    <p>The delivery time may only decrease if a method proves harmful (>10% mortality rate) and no similar methods can be used in exchange of it.</p>


    <p>The federal government must create a fund for natal entity care, administered through the Department of Health
        and Human Services.</p>
    <p>Annual appropriations will be tied to inflation and technological costs.</p>
    <p>Funding will cover equipment, staff training, necessary gestational carrier and adoptive guardian support/education, and natal
        entity care during state custody, prioritizing underserved regions.</p>
    <p>Annual reports to Congress on fund usage and outcomes will be submitted to ensure transparency and
        accountability.</p>
    <p>The BABIES Act establishes a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) under the Department of Health and Human
        Services, comprising neonatologists, obstetricians, bioethicists, and public health experts. The SAC shall assess
        advancements in medical technology every five years and recommend adjustments to the “Current Legal Time Frame Specification” in The BABIES Act
        based on peer-reviewed evidence.</p>
    <p>The committee must hold public hearings and publish draft recommendations for public input at least 90 days
        before submitting final recommendations to Congress.</p>


    <h3>Medical Facilities</h3>
    <p>The BABIES Act applies whenever an abortion takes place. Facilities must maintain life-sustaining equipment capable of 
        supporting natal entities during the delivery term.</p>


    <h4>Transfer</h4>
    <p>Medical facilities can safely transfer responsibility to other medical centers within a reasonable
        life-sustaining distance.</p>
    <p>A written transfer agreement mentioning methods, return of equipment procedures, timelines, etc., must be in
        place by the time the transfer vehicle arrives at the receiving facility.</p>
    <p>Transfers cannot occur to a state that would allow for the death of the natal entity.</p>
    <p>Both facilities must have records of these documents within 30 days.</p>
    <p>Transfers must prioritize the nearest facility capable of providing life-sustaining care, regardless of state
        lines, to minimize delays.</p>
    <p>If the transfer has to cross state lines, the law of the current placement of the natal entity will rule.
    </p>



    <h4>Specific Introductory Timeline:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Year 1: Conduct feasibility studies and secure funding that inspectors of the HHS can review at
            any time.</li>
        <li>Year 2: Begin acquiring equipment and training staff.</li>
        <li>Year 3 to 5: Facilities must have equipment to sustain natal entities simultaneously until they achieve
            independent viability:
            <ul>
                <li>Facilities with fewer than a hundred (100) beds must maintain equipment and supplies to sustain two
                    (2) Natal entities until delivery;</li>
                <li>Facilities with a hundred (100) beds or more must maintain equipment and supplies to support five
                    (5) Natal entities until delivery.</li>
                <li>These numbers may be reduced if transfer facilities that are capable of housing fifty (50) or more
                    natal entities are within a life-sustaining distance, and a written agreement for the right to transfer is in place.
                </li>
                <li>Extended timelines (up to seven years) for rural or underfunded facilities are possible, contingent
                    on a plan to meet requirements within 10 years.</li>
                <li>The facility must report on progress to the fund for natal entity care every two (2) years.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
